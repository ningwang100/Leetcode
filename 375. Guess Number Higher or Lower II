We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.


Solution:

public class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        return solve(dp, 1, n);
    }

    private int solve(int[][] dp, int start, int end) {
    	if (start >= end) {
    		return 0;
    	}
    	if (dp[start][end] != 0) {
    		return dp[start][end];
    	}
    	dp[start][end] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    	for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    		dp[start][end] = Math.min(dp[start][end], i + Math.max(solve(dp, start, i - 1), solve(dp, i + 1, end)));
    	}
    	return dp[start][end];
    }
}
